About myself
======

Introduction
------

I am an aspiring cybersecurity engineer with
  * 2 years of experience doing integrated circuit design and validation.
  * 3 years of experience doing linux system administration.

My greatest strength is my ability and desire to automate tasks, and create an efficient workflow in whatever i do,
  and i have a talent for programming and system administration.

I am passionate about difficult problems, and I value efficiency and elegant solutions

What skills set me apart?
------

Automation.

I wouldn't say I'm proud of being lazy, however, that leads to me wanting to never have to do the same task
  multiple times, in turn, requiring that I read thoroughly the documentation, so as to understand the scope of my 
  work profoundly, which in turn let's me automate the tasks that i learned in the most robust way possible,
  and I can move on to the next interesting problem.

What fuels and motivates me the most?
------

Difficult problems, oftentimes I attempt problems that are considered advanced level, even when just learning new topics, 
  it ends up being a double edge sword, as in doing so I learn a lot about what im researching and i am able to learn 
  state of the art techniques and methods, but also more often than not I end up failing to solve the problem at hand,
  almost always needing to return to it after having acquired more experience in the domain to finish it.

What guides me?
------

Efficiency and elegance. I truly value efficient and elegant solutions. 

Sometimes new technologies, but oftentimes it's really old, but really innovative ideas. 

I like solutions that revolutionaze a field, and that can stand the test of time.

One great example to illustrate this would be private/public key cryptography, it is a simple concept, 
  was developed a long time ago, and it's the basis for almost all modern secure communications, 
  it's an elegant solution, and it's an efficient way to solve the old problems of cryptography.
